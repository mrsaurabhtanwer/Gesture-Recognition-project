# Real-Time Gesture Recognition

## Steps

1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Collect gesture images:
    ```
    python scripts/collect_data.py
    ```
3. Train the model:
    ```
    python scripts/train_model.py
    ```
4. Run real-time inference:
    ```
    python scripts/real_time_inference.py
    ```

Organize your dataset as described and update scripts as needed for your gestures.
